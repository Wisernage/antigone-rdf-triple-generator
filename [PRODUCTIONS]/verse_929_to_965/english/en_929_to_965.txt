CHORUS
The same brutal gusts of wind
Still grip her soul. 930

CREON
I’ll give her guards reason
To weep for their sluggishness.

ANTIGONE
Oh no! These words
Are nearly death.

CREON
I cannot encourage you 935
To hope for a different outcome.

ANTIGONE
O city of my father, o land of Thebes,
Land of the ancient gods,
I am led away now without delay.
Behold, princes of Thebes, 940
The very last of the royal line!
See what things I suffer, and at whose hands,
All because I revered reverence!

CHORUS
Also did Danaë dare to trade away the sky’s
Light for the enclosure of bronze walls; 945
Though she was hidden,
Trapped as if in a grave.
Yet she was of noble lineage,
Oh child, darling, and kept safe
The gold-streamed seed of Zeus. 950
Destiny has a certain terrible power:
Nothing—neither wealth, nor Ares,
Nor lofty heights, nor dark sea-tossed ships—
Can ward off its grasp.
The sharp-tempered Edonian king, son of Dryas, 955
Was tempered and shut up
By Dionysus in craggy confinement.
In such a way did the terror of his madness
And brilliant might recede.
That man soon met that very same god 960
Whom he once pestered
In his mania with biting words.
For he kept trying to halt
The frenzied Bacchantes and the fire of Apollo,
Provoking the flute-loving Muses. 965
