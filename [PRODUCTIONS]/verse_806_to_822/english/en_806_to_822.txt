ANTIGONE

Look at me, o citizens
Of my fatherland, as I set out
On my last journey, as I gaze upon
My last sunlight,
And never again. But Hades, 810
Who puts all to sleep, leads me, still living,
To Acheron’s shore, without the bridal song
Which I was due. No song has been
Sung for me at my marriage,
But instead I shall wed Acheron. 815

CHORUS

And so in renown and with praise
You journey to the corpse-filled depths,
Neither lashed by flesh-wasting plague
Nor chancing upon death by sword; 820
Rather, living alone and self-determined,
You attain for yourself the Death of mortals.
