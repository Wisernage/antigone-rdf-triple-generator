CREON

I will lead her along a deserted path
And then seal her in a rocky cavern there,
Leaving her only as much food as is necessary 775
To clear the city’s name of the charge of murder.
And at some point in that cave she will beg Hades
Not to let her die (since he’s the only god she cares for),
Or at any rate she will realize then that there’s
Excessive pain in worshipping the god of death. 780

CHORUS

Eros, o Eros, unvanquished in battle!
Who falls upon riches,
Who sleeps every night
On a young maiden’s tender cheeks,
Traversing both the depths and 785
The most rural of abodes:
From you indeed neither the deathless gods
Nor any man who lives but one day
Can ever hope to escape;
Your victim is always driven mad. 790
You lead the minds of the just
Astray towards disgraceful insult;
The one to have ignited this
Strife of mankind is you;
Yet desire wins out, shining 795
From the brow of a brilliant bride,
Desire sitting in the office
Of the great divine law.
For, while this battle is waged,
A god jests from afar—Aphrodite! 800
Yet, now, seeing these things,
I am forced to transgress justice,
No longer strong enough to restrain
The river of tears when I see Antigone
Proceeding to her final place of rest. 805
