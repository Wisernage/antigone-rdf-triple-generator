ANTIGONE

I have heard
How our Phrygian guest, Niobe,
The daughter of Tantalus, died a miserable death 825
Near lofty Mount Sipylus. The growth of rock, like clinging ivy,
Subdued her,
Now—as the story goes—
She melts away. Rain and snow
Never leave her. 830
But with tears streaming down her face,
She dampens the ridges of the mountain. I am
Most like her, as the god leads me to my sleep.

CHORUS
Yet she was not only god-born but also a goddess herself,
While we are but mortals, born from mortals. 835
Still, it is great for one in the throes of death
To hear that she has obtained the luck of a god
In life and in death.

ANTIGONE
Oh, now you’re mocking me!
Why, by my father’s gods, 840
Do you insult me to my face,
And not wait until I’ve gone,
My city and you, her wealthiest citizens?
Ah! Springs of Dirce and 845
Grove of Thebes of many chariots,
You at least I can count on to witness
How I go, unwept by my loved ones,
To my rock-heap prison,
To my unknown tomb. 850
Ah! Unhappy one! I neither live
Among mortals nor shades,
Neither with the living nor the dead.

CHORUS
You rushed through the depths of recklessness
For the high throne of Dike, 855
But you have fallen, oh child, fallen very far.
Now you will pay for your father’s crimes.

ANTIGONE
You have touched upon
My most painful memory,
The thrice-told doom of my father 860
And our whole
Destiny, that of the
Famed Labdacids.
Oh, our mother’s disaster of a marriage
And my father’s incestuous intercourse 865
With his ill-fated mother!
From such people I, the miserable one, was born!
I go to them
To live, accursed, unmarried.
Ah, my brother who secured 870
An ill-fated marriage,
In your death you have slain me alive.
