You are an expert annotator of Ancient Greek tragedies and an ontology-aware triple extractor. Your task is to read the passage between <TEXT> and </TEXT> and output ONLY valid RDF/Turtle triples that follow exactly the Antigone Ontology provided. Every triple must use individuals created under the prefix ":" and must use only the classes and properties already defined in the ontology. Do not invent new properties.

Your extraction task covers six types of high-level semantic information: intentions and objectives, moral justifications, emotional states, semantic contradictions, causal relationships, and thematic signals. For each case, you must represent the information using the ontology classes and object/datatype properties exactly as defined.

Instructions for each category:

1. Intentions and Objectives: Represent intentions by creating an individual of class :Motivation. Link characters to motivations using :hasMotivation. If the intention involves a deliberate choice, also create a :MoralDecision individual and connect the character using :makesMoralDecision. Provide a short description of the motivation or decision using :description.

2. Moral Justifications: Represent moral justifications through :EthicalPrinciple or :MoralDecision instances. Link characters to the principle they uphold using :advocatesFor. Provide a description of the principle or reasoning using :description.

3. Emotional States: Create an individual of class :Emotion and link it to the character using :experiencesEmotion. Include a :description explaining the emotion.

4. Semantic Contradictions: Represent contradictions as instances of :Conflict. Connect this conflict to the relevant characters, principles, or laws using :conflictBetween. Optionally link the containing scene, speech, or play using :hasConflict.

5. Causal Relationships: Use the generic property :relatedTo to represent causal or consequential links between events, actions, or decisions. You may create individuals of type :MoralDecision, :Motivation, or generic owl:Thing to represent the events being related. Add a :description when necessary.

6. Thematic Signals: Represent themes as individuals of class :Theme. Connect themes to scenes, speeches, or lines using :hasTheme or :developsTheme. Provide a :description summarizing the thematic idea.

General rules:

– Output only valid RDF Turtle. No commentary, no explanation.
– Use only the following prefixes:

@prefix : <http://example.org/antigone#> .
@prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#> .

– All individuals you create must be typed (for example: “a :Emotion”, “a :Motivation”, “a :Conflict”, “a :Theme”, “a :MoralDecision”, “a :EthicalPrinciple”, “a :Character”, etc.).
– Use concise CamelCase identifiers such as :AntigoneMotivation1, :CreonDecision2, :Conflict3, :Grief1, :JusticeTheme1, etc.
– Provide :description literals for motivations, emotions, moral principles, themes, and events when appropriate.
– Do not hallucinate information not supported by the text.
– Be exhaustive: extract all possible instances of intentions, emotions, principles, contradictions, causal relations, and themes that can be grounded in the passage.
– You may create additional individuals such as actions, events, decisions, or laws as long as you type them using existing ontology classes and link them using existing ontology properties.
– Characters mentioned in the passage must be represented as individuals of class :Character if they are not already established in previous output.
– The output must be fully self-contained and syntactically valid Turtle.

After applying these rules, output the RDF/Turtle triples for the passage below and nothing else.
